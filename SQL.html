											</header>
											<p align="justify">The dataset for this project came readily clean and is easily accessible <a href="https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-getting-started/postgresql-sample-database/">here</a>. 

												<ul>
													<li>
														Query 1 -  Using PostgreSQL, this Query generates the top 10 family-friendly movies titles based on their respective rental count. Observations from Tableau generated visuals 
														informs that the top ten family-appropriate movies range between 30 t0 32 total rental counts. Movie titles and subcategories are also provided for the purpose of recommendation.
													</li>
													<li>
														Query 2 - I decided to write a Query to investigate each rental store's performance for the months of February, March, April and May for year 2007.
														The clustered bar chart generated by Tableau helps to underatand each store's performance at a glance. As seen, Store ID 1 outperforms Store ID 2 except in the month of April 2007.

											<p align="justify">
												<ul>
													<li>
														Query 3 - More insights was drawn from the data set provided by querying the top five paying customers in the database. 
														Top five customer names, monthly expense on DVD rentals and the total count of movies rented in each months.
														Tableau helps to visualise all these insights at a glance. per customer. As seen, Eleanor Huntmade the highes
														 cummulative payment($100.78) in the month of April 2007.
													</li>
													<li>
														Query 4 - For the top 25 horror movies according To Rental Duration, how do they compare to the rental duration
														 of the entire movie Inventory In terms of quartile distribution? From the Tableau visualisation, a quartile 
														 distribution grouping shows the relationship between their rental distribution categories and that of  the entire 
														 movie inventory. Majority(14) of the top 25 Horror movies fall in the fourth quartile of the entire rental duration in 
														 the ‘dvdrental’ Database.

												<ul>
													<li>The west region is the most profitable region in terms of revenue generation.</li>
													<li>Premium Motor Spirit(PMS) is the most sold white product(WP) for the company in terms of litres and revenue generation.</li>
													<li>Gbagada retail sales station generated the highest revenue for the period in view.</li>
													<li>Mile 1 retail station needs urgent intervention to improve sales figures as it is the least performing station in terms of volume and revenue generation.</li>

											<p align="justify"> The data source for this project was <a href=https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/carrie1/ecommerce-data?resource=download>Kaggle</a>. A ficticious sales data for a clothing store. I engineered an extra feature named "age category".
												Some of the insights generated from this dashboard include:
												<ul>
													<li>Based on the product purchase chart, females dominate all categories of product purchase from this store.</li>
													<li>Revenue generated in year 2021 is more than that of 2020. The Covid 19 pandemic definitely affected sales.</li>
													<li>The middle aged customers (40-49 yrs) spent the most amount of money in year 2020 while younger people aged 20 to 39 spent more 
														in 2021 as observed via the dashboard.

											<h3>Tableau Harvest Tracker</h3>
										</header>
										<p align="justify">This dashboard serves as a recovery status tracker for a monitoring and evaluating project spanning across 12 northern states in Nigeria. This dashboard is a simplistic adaptations of a more robust solution
											I designed for effective tracking and monitoring of project status.	Early stages of harvest agreggation shows submitted produce in terms of bags, with size ranging between 50kg to 100kg. I enjoy displaying map adaptation anaytics with
											Tableau due to its flexibilty.

												started and ended in these stations repectively. Based on cell output 22, The top two busiest end stations are 'San Francisco Caltrain Station 2' 
												and 'Market St at 10th St' with both of them switching postions for the busiest start stations plot. Considering the whole dataset, San Francisco Caltrain Station 2 is busiest bike station.

												<li><h3>Duration VS User Type & Gender Type</h3></li>
											</ul>
											<p align="justify">My bivariate explorations starts with investigating the time spent on bike rides with respect to different gender catgeories as well as User Type categories.
												Using seaborne's Violin plot, this reveals that a majority of the subscriber category members travel duration fall within the range of 1 to 10 minutes with over 50% falling below 10 minutes. The customer category have slightly over 25% of them with trip durations lower than 10 minutes while the rest fall above the 10 minutes cap. A more spreadout trip duration distribution is obeserved in the customer category type.
												The 'male', 'female' and 'other' gender types show similiar relationships with the trip duration variable regardless of their respective sample size.

											</ul>
											<p align="justify">I decided to investigate for existing patterns between categorical and numerical data types present in my dataset. A matrix of box plots was used for this visualisation. I started with
												storing all catgeorical and numeric features into two major variables ("numeric_var" and "categoric_vars") and then parsing them into Seaborne's ".boxplot" method.	
											</p>
											<p align="justify"> Visual ouput from cell 27 informs that the average age of all gender and customer category is less that 40 yrs albeit several outliers present in the dataset.
												From the gender point of view, average trip duration is less than 10 minutes albeit several outlier present in the distribution. From the user_type point of view, average 
												trip duration for Customer category is over 10 minutes while that of the Subscriber category are less than 10 minutes.

											<ul>
												<li><h3>Gender Activity Across Top 5 Busiest Start Stations</h3></li>
											</ul>
											<p align="justify"> For multivariate visualisation, I decided to work with three major variables in my dataset "member_gender","start_station_name" and "duration_mins".
												Using the "member_gender" as hue for my Seaborne barplot, notable insights show that more male gender type in the dataset doesn't directly interprets to a dominance
												 in all variables, this came as a surprise. Here in the top 5 busiest start stations, it can be seen that the Other gender category keeps the 'San Francisco Caltrain Station 2' and
												  'Powell St BART Station (Market St at 4th St) stations the busiest in terms of trip durations at start stations.

												<li><h4>Do SMS prompts play an important role in appoinment showup rates?</h4></li>
												<p>Investigating the influence of SMS prompts require drilling further into the first queries created for our analysis('showup' and 'nshowup'). Cell 24 contains statements generating the number of people that receives SMS and showedup for their appointments and those that didn't show despite receiving SMS prompts.</p>
												<p>As seen in the plots from cell output 29, clearly, SMS prompts doesn't seem to influence attendance in any way;
													<ol>
														<li>A large percentage(83.3%) of people that didn't receive SMS prompts honored their appoinments while 16.7% did not.</li>												
														<li>72.4% of SMS receivers honored their appoinment but this is obviously lesser than the attendees that did not receive any SMS prompts whatsoever.</li>

												<li><h4>What percentage of males and females are enrolled in welfare programs?</h4></li>
												<p>Exploring the distribution of scholarship enrolments by gender involves categorising our dataframe (cell 30) into the existing gender distribution and summing up the scholarship values because the data type in the 'scholarship' column is 'int' and it consists of two distinct values(0 and 1). Since I intend to investigate the percentage distribution, the total count for both male and female genders in our dataset needs to be calculated as given in cell output 31.</p>
												<p>Since I intend to investigate the percentage distribution, the total count for both male and female genders in our dataset needs to be calculated as given in cell 31 . Investigating using percentage was chosen because the number of females in the distribution far outnumbers the males so plotting aggregates like count may not communicate the exact picture of the welfare enrollment distribution amongst genders(cell 32).</p>
												<p>Highlights from the chart include;
													<ol>
														<li>Females have a higher percentage of enrollment in wellfare programmes than males. More than twice the percentage of enrolled men to be precise.</li>												
														<li>Only 5.2% of the male distribution are enrolled in welfare programmes.</li>
